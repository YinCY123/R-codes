`caret` includes several functions to pre-process the predictor data. It assumes that all of the data are numeric (i.e. factors have been converted to dummy variables via `model.matrix`, `dummyVars` or other means).  

Note that the later chapter on using `recipes` with `train` shows how that approach can offer a more diverse and customizable interface to pre-processing in the package.
